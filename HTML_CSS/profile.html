I am a Master of Computer Science in Computational Engineering at Technical University 
of Dresden, Germany. In addition, I have completed Master of Sensor System Technology at Karlsurhe University of Applied Sciences, Germany. During My study period of time,
I have learned different development process, to implement the system where I can use programming language. I have good knowledge in different programming languages such as Java, C++, Android,
 Java Script, Ruby, HTML/CSS.

Learning code is a reusable, challenging and exciting process, same implementation can be done with different coding technique. I love to do scrum meeting; what I have done
yesterday, what I will do today and how I will solve the problem. Writing program is a challenging issue, sharing achievement, bugs, errors with other students is also part of 
the development process, too. I want to see my -self as a Full Stack developer, will look for a job as a developer, who will able to build the service oriented architecture 
with the help of web development process.
